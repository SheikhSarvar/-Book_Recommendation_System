# Book_Recommendation_System
A recommendation system helps an organization to create loyal customers and build trust by
them desired products and services for which they came on your site. The recommendation
system today are so powerful that they can handle the new customer too who has visited the
site for the first time. They recommend the products which are currently trending or highly
rated and they can also recommend the products which bring maximum profit to the company.

# Problem Statement:-

Recommender systems are algorithms aimed at suggesting relevant items to users (movies,
books, products). Recommender systems are really critical in some industries as they can
generate a huge amount of income when they are efficient or can also be a way to stand out
significantly from competitors.
In this project, we create a book recommendation system for users through Unsupervised
Machine Learning using three datasets - Books.csv, Users.csv, Ratings.csv
